# Govrnanza
An API governance system for managing APIs in large organisations.

This is a series of APIs that I am building as part of a series on my blog: http://jack-vanlightly.com/blog/2017/8/5/net-core-web-api-series-introduction

Govrnanza is a vehicle for learning about API implementation with .NET Core and other technologies. I am not suggesting that it will be a best in class governance framework. However, if anyone does want to contribute then I would be more than happy to see how far we can take it.
